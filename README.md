# Local Installation Environment

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Fairseq version used**

```
https://github.com/yc1999/fairseq.git
```

This version of Fairseq is based on the official version `'1.0.0a0+c8d6fb1'`. The only modification is in the `fairseq/models/transformer/transformer_config.py` file, with no other changes.

Other packages, such as torch, should be installed separately. You can refer to the `requirements.txt` file in this directory for installation.

# Quick Start

1. Set the following three environment variables in the shell command line:

   ```
   export save_root=${YOUR_PROJECT_PATH}/save
   export project_root=${YOUR_PROJECT_PATH}
   export dataset_root=${YOUR_PROJECT_PATH}/dataset  
   ```
2. Train the model using the following command:

   ```
   # zh-en
   bash ${project_root}/scripts/rerank/zh-en/start_train.sh bi_context
   # bash ${project_root}/scripts/rerank/zh-en/start_train.sh prefix
   # bash ${project_root}/scripts/rerank/zh-en/start_train.sh suffix
   # bash ${project_root}/scripts/rerank/zh-en/start_train.sh zero_context

   # en-zh
   bash ${project_root}/scripts/rerank/en-zh/train_pretrained.sh bi_context

   # de-en
   bash ${project_root}/scripts/rerank/de-en/train_pretrained.sh bi_context

   # en-de
   bash ${project_root}/scripts/rerank/en-de/train_pretrained.sh bi_context
   ```
3. After training is completed, run the following command to infer the model:

   ```
   bash ${project_root}/scripts/rerank/zh-en/start_valid.sh
   ```

    Note: Please modify the ckpt directory in `valid.sh` as needed.
